        <p>Jitsi Meet lets you stay in touch with all your teams, be they family, friends, or colleagues. Instant video conferences, efficiently adapting to your scale.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Works with any Jitsi deployment.</li>
            <li>Unlimited users: There are no artificial restrictions on the number of users or conference participants. Server power and bandwidth are the only limiting factors.</li>
            <li>No account needed.</li>
            <li>Lock-protected rooms: Control the access to your conferences with a password.</li>
            <li>Encrypted by default.</li>
            <li>Experimental End-to-End Encryption support for further enhanced security.</li>
            <li>High quality: Audio and video are delivered with the clarity and richness of Opus and VP8.</li>
            <li>Web browser ready: No downloads are required of your friends to join the conversation. Jitsi Meet works directly within their browsers as well. Simply share your conference URL with others to get started.</li>
            <li>100% open source: Powered by awesome communities from all over the world. And your friends at Atlassian.</li>
            <li>Invite by pretty URLs: You can meet at the easy to remember https://MySite.com/OurConf of your choice instead of joining the hard to remember rooms with seemingly random sequences of numbers and letters in their names.</li>
            <li>Support for jitsi-meet:// URLs, for linking directly to conversations.</li>
        </ul>
